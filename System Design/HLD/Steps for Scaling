### *Steps for Scaling:*

1. *Single Server:*
    - Basic setup with a single server for the application, database, and client.
    - Suitable for the initial stage with zero users.
2. *Application and Database Separation:*
    - Introduces a separate layer for the application server, handling business logic.
    - Database server handles data storage and retrieval.
    - Enables independent scaling of both application and database.
3. *Load Balancing and Multiple Application Servers:*
    - Introduces a load balancer to distribute incoming requests across multiple application servers.
    - Load balancer provides security and privacy.
    - Ensures efficient handling of increased traffic by distributing workload.
4. *Database Replication:*
    - Implements a master-slave configuration for the database.
    - Master database handles write operations, while slave databases handle read operations.
    - Improves performance and provides redundancy in case of database failure.

    - Utilizes a caching layer to store frequently accessed data in memory.
    - Application server checks the cache first before accessing the database.
    - Reduces database load and improves response time.
    - Uses time-to-live (TTL) to manage cached data expiry.

    - Uses a distributed network of servers to cache static content closer to users.
    - Reduces latency and improves website performance for users worldwide.
    - Handles requests for static content like images, videos, and JavaScript files.
    - In case of cache miss, CDN first ask neighbour CDN for the data then from origin DB.
7. *Multiple Data Centers:*
    - Distributes the application and database across multiple data centers.
    - Reduces load on individual data centers and improves reliability.
    - Enables geographically distributed user access with minimal latency.
    - Load balancer distributes requests to different data centers based on user location.
[V.V.IMPT] 8. *Messaging Queues:*
    - Uses messaging queues to handle asynchronous tasks like sending notifications or emails.
    - Decouples tasks from the main application flow.
    - Improves performance and reliability by handling high-volume tasks efficiently.
    - Utilizes messaging platforms like RabbitMQ or Kafka.
[V.V.IMPT] 9. *Database Scaling:*
    - *Vertical Scaling:* Increase the capacity of existing database servers (CPU, RAM). This has limitations and eventually reaches a ceiling.
    - *Horizontal Scaling / Data Sharding :* Split the database into multiple servers or shards, distributing data across them. This offers better scalability.
        - Splits data across multiple databases or tables based on a specific key.
        - Can be implemented through vertical sharding (splitting columns) or horizontal sharding (splitting rows) .
